      <h2>Exotic Dance moves</h2>
      <p>
        Our campus provides the best place for you to do your research on
        certain dances performed through different eras of the world Here are
        some of the ones I've researched;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <dl>
          <dt>Chicken Dance</dt>
          <dd>
            This dance was performed by the southern tribe where the villagers
            would form a ring around a sheep and move their hands and legs like
            chickens. This was believed to help their livestock create more
            produce and bring blessings to them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Robotic dance</dt>
          <dd>
            This dance consists of a person straightening their arms and legs
            half way and moving in a robot like way. It was first discovered by
            researchers being done by people living in the arctic in the
            seventeenth century. It has since gained the attention and hype of
            the <strong><em>robot dance</em></strong> though recent research
            suggests the people moved that way due to the cold.
          </dd>
          <dt>Shaking dance</dt>
          <dd>
            This was a dance by our ancestors at a time before fire was
            invented. It showed how our ancestors used to huddle close together
            while lying down and make imperceptibly small movements rapidly to
            gain warmth. Has since inspired modern dances like electro.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We thank you for reaching out to us and hope that I have answered all
        your questions satisfactorially

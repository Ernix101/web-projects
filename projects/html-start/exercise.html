      Exercise has its perks; keeps you strong,motivated and helps you do stuff
      you werent initially capable of.but very few people know its underlying
      benefits
    </p>
    <p>Here they are grouped according to different categories</p>
    <ul>
      <li>medical</li>
      <li>physical</li>
      <li>emotional</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First we'll start with the medical health benefits. In this article we
      shall cover the more biological reasons to start exercises. Some might say
      it's the most important reason
    </p>
    <h2>MEDICAL PURPOSE OF BECOMING MORE FIT</h2>
    <p>
      If it wasnt already widely known exercise has a lot of health benefits.
      you would be more likely to live a healthier lifestyke if you stay fit.
      Here are the reasons
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To improve one's blood circulation= When your body performs a certain
        exerting activity, the blood flow is usually increased to help oxygen
        reach the muscles and keep your body stable
      </li>
      <li>
        To help with muscle mass increase for future activiy of the same or
        different but equally exerting type= When you perform that workout, for
        example squats when lifting a heavy weight, your muscle mass on the
        exerted area increases. This is usually more gradual and works over a
        longer time but the changes can be seen soon enough when similar tasks
        grow easier with time. Quite helpful isnt it? For bigger growth, heavier
        and more exerting exercise is needed. Which is why there are all sorts
        of heavy and forcefully exerting equipment at a gym
      </li>
      <li>
        To prevent common lifestyle diseases which affect most people= The
        reason why high blood pressure, diabetes and cardiac issues isnt always
        related to genetics or exposure. A lot of the times, it can be as a
        result of poor sedantary habits.

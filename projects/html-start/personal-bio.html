            <h2>My Backstory</h2>

            <p>I grew up in a loving christian family and made a couple of friends around my neighborhood</p>
            <p>I used to like playing with phones and phone games. Later on I started playing on PS and consoles, so I had a fascination with technology</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I first started in EarlyBird Kindergarten would influence a small kindergartener to love a language so soon. Well, I can say it was somewhere between a fluent pretty teacher and amazing cartoons with advanced English exposure</p>
            <p>I was later able to improve in that subject early on</p>
            <p>Later on, in Primary level, I discovered a preference for it since it was mandatory for pupils to speak in that language.</p>
            <p>I was mostly focused on my studies and was able to make it through KCPE with 400 marks and above</p>
            <p>High School posed a lot of challenges for me with peer pressure, massive workload and dangers like dormiory burning. Luckily, by the Grace of God, I made it through.</p>
            <p>In High School, I had participated in club events such as Computer club, Aviation and Chess. Even Music club at one time.</p>
            <p>At the end of High School, I did my KCSE examination and was selected to join Kenyatta University where I pursued BSC in Health Services Management.</p>

        <section id="Hobbies">
            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Since being a small human being, I was always fascinated by languages.</p>
            <p>Being able to articulate and communicate my thoughts and complex ideas in a diverse number of ways and through creative command of language was breath-taking for me.</p>
            <p>So knowing that, I decided to expand it and learn a foreign language. I learned French enthusiastically since it's one of the most highly regarded latin descent languages and also the language of love as some called it. Either way, it was fun.</p>
            <p>It still is "Bonne chance!"</p>
            <p>Another language I decided to look into was Mandarin. It's one of the more strategically advantageous according to research and global trends which I liked to some extent, but I was honestly just enjoying the experience and new sentence structures, for the fun of it.</p>
            <p>Recently, I,ve started taking up chess as a new hobby that I'm finding quite interesting as well. Being able to counter and predict your opponents' next move in a game of wit is engaging.</p>
